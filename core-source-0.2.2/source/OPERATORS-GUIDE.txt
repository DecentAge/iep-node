How to prepare my computer to run the core?
--------------------------------

The core needs Java 8 Oracle JVM to run. Please download and install java first.

How to verify the core?
-----------------------

It is **highly** recommended to verify the SHA256 signature every time you download 
new version.
  

How to configure the core?
-------------------------

There are many configuration parameters that could be changed, but the defaults
are set so that normally you can run the program immediately after unpacking,
without any additional configuration. To see what options are there, open the
conf/custom.properties file. You do not need to delete the defaults packaged in 
core.jar, the settings in conf/custom.properties override those properties. 
This way, when upgrading the software, you can safely overwrite those in core.jar
with the updated file from the new package, while your customizations remain
safe in the conf/custom.properties file.


How to make the core API public accessible?
-------------------------------------
To make your node public accessible and allow client connections you have to
uncomment these three lines (just remove #) and change the admin password in
your conf/custom.properties file.

 - xin.allowedBotHosts=*; 127.0.0.1; localhost; [0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1];
 - xin.apiServerHost=0.0.0.0
 - xin.adminPassword=***yourOwnRandomPassword***

In default mode you can connect your wallet to your local node anytime on the fly 
by changing the API node in 'options/nodes and connection' to LOCAL_HOST. Some 
features like block generation and shuffling asking for a local node due to 
security reasons.

NOTE: Don't forget to set a new admin password and don't use any secret phrase
from your wallet/account!


How long does it take to sync the chain?
-----------------------------------------
This depends on your computer, internet connection and block height. At current 
block height 600000 it takes around 60 min. in average to get in sync with chain.


How to update the core?
-----------------------
Just unpack a new version over the existing installation directory then run
the new core. The core will upgrade the database if necessary. Check the custom
properties file (/core/bin/conf) and adjust as needed.

Open custom.properties in /core/bin/conf and set: 

 xin.allowedToForge=SPECIFIC ACCOUNT or * for all
 xin.maxNumberOfForgers=100
