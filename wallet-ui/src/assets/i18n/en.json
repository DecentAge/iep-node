The procedure consists of complex cryptographic operations that use a <strong> PASSPHRASE </strong> (a series of 15 random words) to create your <strong> UNIQUE ACCOUNT ADDRESS </strong>. This <strong> PASSPHRASE </strong> is extremely important and must be kept in safe place, since it's <strong> THE ONLY WAY </strong> to access your account. If you lose it you lose access to your account and your funds! The Foundation holds no responsibility for lost funds resulting from misplaced passphrases. The account passphrase and other vital information must be immediately saved and written down for your own safety. Make sure that you select the entire passphrase length before keeping it and check again your account address by logging in and compare the account address with the account address generated from this PASSPHRASE here before making your first transfer.
